# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020 implemented in Julia

### Day 1
Pretty trivial. Julia provides no extra benefit.

### Day 2
Trivial again. Again no special benefit of Julia, but I'm thankful that Julia has regex support, and I like the array
functions with predicates and the fact that comparisons can be chained.

### Day 3
Trivial again. Modular arithmetic is a pain when dealing with array indexes because of the 1-based indexing.

### Day 4
Tedious, but trivial again due to regex support.

### Day 5
Trivial. Basic binary conversion.
