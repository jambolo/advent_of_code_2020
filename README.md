# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020 implemented in Julia

### Day 1
Pretty trivial. Julia provides no extra benefit.

### Day 2
Trivial again. Again no special benefit of Julia, but I'm thankful that Julia has regex support, and I like the array
functions with predicates and the fact that comparisons can be chained.
