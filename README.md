# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020 implemented in Julia

### Day 1
Julia provides no extra benefit.

### Day 2
Again no special benefit of Julia, but I'm thankful that Julia has regex support, and I like the array
functions with predicates and the fact that comparisons can be chained.

### Day 3
Modular arithmetic is a pain when dealing with array indexes because of the 1-based indexing.

### Day 4
Regex support is key.

### Day 5
Basic binary conversion.

### Day 6
Support of sets in Julia helped.

### Day 7
Had problems with mutability and recursion in julia. I had problems with a complicated regex and a clunky IDE.
